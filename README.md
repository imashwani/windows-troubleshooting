# windows-troubleshooting

this include few things which i encountered and was able to rectify them i will mentio the seps taht worked for me  
1. touchpad not working after waking from sleep / hibernation 

    for this i uninstaled the latest version of the drivers and installed the one older version and it worked in my case as i had
    Dell Synaptic Touchpad
    
2.A ghost account apeared on logon screen after changing the system name
    for this i disabled autologon from windows which u can do by pressing start+R and type netplwiz and there deselct the option
    -user must enter the username and passsword to use this computer   then restart your computer this will solve the problem.
